# Dark Restore M2 — implementation checkpoint

This branch remains a draft. It must not be merged or installed as a completed M2 feature.

## Implemented

- Owner-only read-only quotes with group mapping and exact historical aggregates.
- Clients can load a server-approved snapshot, map groups, preview the import, commit it and look up the resulting receipt as the owner. Local JSON remains a private preview.
- Stage an independent snapshot at HUB startup with `-darkrestore-snapshot`, `-darkrestore-sha256` and `-darkrestore-as-of` on an explicitly ownership-enabled LAB. The copy and its parent directory must be private. Requests carry the review hash and mappings.
- Rebuild the review from the private SHA-pinned source snapshot before import; internally consistent browser JSON is insufficient.
- Preserve verified UUID, exact expiry, quota, archive flag, source review and historical group totals, including promoted and blocked records.
- Keep imported identities disabled with incomplete native usage baseline until independently verified traffic cutover.
- Store historical bytes separately from post-import native counters; expose a read-only historical/current/combined projection with an explicit cutover-verification flag.
- Atomically persist immutable receipts, source identities, groups, skips and usage seeds.
- Replay the same event without duplication; reject changed requests, reimport of a consumed source, and UUID collisions across source snapshots.
- Import and assignment do not debit representative credit. Existing ownership transfer enforces current management scope; later renewal charges the current representative.
- Reopen and native offline backup validation reject missing or contradictory import schema/history.

## Verified by automated tests

- Verified synthetic legacy SQLite snapshot to actual PRO Clients, preserving source bytes.
- Authenticated Chromium login, group mapping, preview, commit and receipt recovery after reload against a disposable Go server and SQLite.
- Atomic rollback on injected write failure; successful retry after rollback.
- Same-request replay and receipt lookup; receipt privacy.
- Reopen recovery and native offline backup validation.
- Archived/promoted/blocked historical totals and safe subset import.
- Ownership transfer, previous-manager rejection, current-manager renewal charging.
- Source authenticity, tampered accounting, uncertain UUID and group mapping rejection.
- Corruption rejection on reopen and backup validation.

These tests use isolated synthetic databases. They are not installed LAB acceptance or production migration.

## Remaining gates

- Separate source event-history retention beyond the M1 review aggregates.
- Verified cutover/checkpoint design, remaining-quota policy, and native/subscription activation acceptance. No incomplete baseline may be marked complete by an API request.
- Approved legacy-unlimited plan policy; uncertain unlimited records currently remain blocked.
- Complete receipt/entry/skip semantic validation and pagination for large recovery sets.
- M3–M5: real process interruption, concurrent/restart recovery, accounting, subscription and installed LAB acceptance.
- Full CI and independent scope review before merge; versioned LAB installation afterward.
- Telegram Bot and Store integration only after these gates, using the panel's existing wallet/order/usage logic.

No production HUB, users, representatives, bots, DNS or Nodes are modified by this work.
